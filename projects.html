                MIDI devices are hardware devices that output data streams that can be interpreted by softwares as musical instruments. 
                I developed this program to make use of a MIDI device I owned in order to control some Linux system functionalities that I found cumbersome. <br><br>
                In order to maximize performance I coded this primarily in Bash, and I took the opportunity to code the remainder using Python which was a new language to me at the time. 
                As asynchronous paradigms in Bash make use of multiple threads I decided to instead use multiple files instead to improve readability to future prospective users. <br>
                The end result was a program that could run in the background and interpret dial turns and key presses as Bash commands.

                This program was originally developed for a Translational Oncology Laboratory to automate the collation of excel documents.<br><br>
                Every workday each research associate records information about cell-line experiments, each experiment has a control plate and multiple experimental plates with are exposed to drugs. Data about this experiment is recorded once when the experiment is started and again after 7 days.
                This data is recorded as a new sheet on an excel document for that individual's work during that week. The data needed to be standardized based on a template made by the manager.

            <p class="project-description">This is a program I made to serve as an interactive map of the Star-Wars universe. 
                The program opens a window that displays the map, and the primary functionality is the ability to click on a location and either add a description, or read a previously stored description. 
                <br>
                <br>
                I developed this program due to my appreciation of interactive maps and in response to the scarcity of interactive maps on the internet. 
                The Star-Wars galaxy was always an interest of mine, so while this application is geared toward maps that span dozens of solar systems it can technically be used for any map.
                <br>
                <br>
                This program, like most of my programs are intended to be picked up by beginner programmers to learn techniques such as creating windows with images, using mouse click events, and drawing overlays on the map programmatically.

            <p class="project-description">This program was made in collaboration with a peer of mine in a class, it analyzes pixels of an image and performs a Hierarchic Clustering algorithm upon it to form non-intersecting groups of colors in the image. 
                <br>
                <br>
                What makes this program particularly special is that it actually uses multiple threads to perform the analysis, resulting in significantly faster operation time. The image on the right is not from the actual program, it was taken from documentation of a MatLab algortihm by Anton Semechko.</p>
